The contents of dx80 were taken from the Allegro game programming library project:
http://alleg.sourceforge.net

An alternate source is the SDL project:
SDL_URL="http://www.libsdl.org/extras/win32/common"
OPENGL_ARCHIVE="opengl-devel.tar.gz"
DIRECTX_ARCHIVE="directx-devel.tar.gz"

But I don't know if they include all the needed headers.
