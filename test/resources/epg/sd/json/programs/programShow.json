        "description": "When their plane has trouble while on a flight to Paris, three glamorous LA women find themselves in a completely new and unexpected place. Feeling the need for a girls-only, once-in-a-lifetime trip, Melanie cashes in her airline miles to finance a trip to the city of light for herself and her two best friends, Joy and Victoria, all \"of a certain age\" and feeling less than desirable. They never make it to Paris, though -- when the stricken plane lands in Cleveland, the women suddenly find they're popular with the men there. Realizing that while they may be lukewarm in LA, they're hot in Cleveland, the women decide to relocate. They immediately fall in love with their rental house. It takes a little longer, however, for them to warm up to the house's longtime caretaker (Betty White)."
